# Challenge_5


## In this challenge I was to create a financial analysis tool for an aspiring retiree. I calculated the total balance of the cypto, stock, and bonds in their portfolio. I then organized the data collected into a data frame and simulated the trajectory of their portfolio within the next 10-30 years. My data was inaccurate due to an error I could not find but all in all the challenge was completed.
